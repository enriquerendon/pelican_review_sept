**SAP In-House Cash** is used for processing internal and external payment transactions within a group or company. By using SAP In-House Cash you can reduce the number of external bank accounts you hold and the volume of foreign payments you have to make. SAP In-House Cash is implemented at a central location within a group of companies, for example, in head office.
